This text-based RPG was built using:

Java
Spring
Java Swing
MongoDB
Description
I used multiple classes, inheritance and polymorphism, all backed by an SQL database, to create a sprawling puzzle-based text adventure based on the Mothman legend. I have:

Created an application that makes requests to my own database and saves data on characters, enemies, locations, and game items, allowing the user to save their progress
Created a Graphical User Interface using a JFrame.
Used structures that demonstrate a clear grasp of Object-Orientated modelling
Been able to take input from the users choices and updated what they see and determine the outcome of encounters with other characters
Created a player, enemies, items and locations for the adventure. The user is able to move between these locations

Extensions
I created an eye-catching GUI with images that change according to player encounters. It also features many puzzles to solve and a combat system with game logic.

To play this game, first create db on your computer named "pointpleasant", then run PointPleasantGameApplication.
